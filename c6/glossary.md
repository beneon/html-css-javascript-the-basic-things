Angle  classification  of  malocclusion:A classification of malocclusion introduced by Edward H. Angle (1855-1930). The governing criterion is the anteroposterior relationship of maxillary and mandibular first molars.
Class  I  malocclusion:(neutroclusion) A malocclusion in which the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar occludes in the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar. "Class I" is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for normal occlusion, whereas it signifies only a normal sagittal relationship of maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth as they meet.
Class  II  malocclusion:(distoclusion) A distal (posterior) placement of the mandibular (lower) molar, a mesial (anterior) relationship of the maxillary (upper), or a combination of the two. The mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar occludes mesial to the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar, usually near the embrasure between the mandibular molar and second  premolar.
Class  II , Division  1:A Class II molar relationship with proclined maxillary incisors.
Class  II , Division  2:A Class II molar relationship, usually with the maxillary central incisors tipped lingually, the maxillary lateral incisors tipped labially. This malocclusion, in many instances, has and an excessive overbite. Subdivision of any malocclusion category denotes a unilateral malocclusion classification (e.g. Class II, division 2, subdivision).
Class  III  malocclusion:(mesioclusion) Mesial (anterior) relationship of the mandibular first molar to the maxillary first molar, a retruded relationship of the maxillary first molar to the mandibular, or a combination of the two. The mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar will typically occlude near the embrasure between the mandibular first and second molars.

In the latter case, the periodontal ligament is obliterated by a 'bony bridge' and the tooth root is fused to the alveolar bone. Dental ankylosis prevents both eruption and orthodontic movement. In a growing child, an ankylosed tooth appears to 'submerge' as adjacent unaffected teeth and alveolar bone continue their normal pattern of eruption and growth.

center  of  resistance:The center of resistance (CR) of a tooth is the point of concentrated resistance to movement. A force that acts on a body at CR causes a tooth to translate in the direction of the line of force without rotation. The center of resistance can be considered an area rather than a point in three dimensions. In free space, the CR is the center of the tooth which happens to correspond to the center of gravity of the tooth.
center  of  rotation:The point about which a body appears to have rotated in a nontranslational plane (two-dimensional) displacement.
centric  occlusion:Mandibular position dictated by maximum and habitual intercuspation of the maxillary and mandibular teeth; variously referred to as intercuspal position, habitual centric, usual occlusal position. The condylar position may or may not be in harmony with centric relation. Because of this, the term habitual occlusion is preferable. Historically, a gnathologic and articulator oriented term.
centric  relation:A gnathologic term that denotes optimal condyle-articular eminence-glenoid fossa relationships, determined by muscle balance and independent of tooth intercuspation. Changing concepts no longer accept the most retruded, rearmost or hinge axis definition, originally derived from prosthetic articulators. To the orthodontist, the condylar position can vary somewhat, but is generally recognized as high on the posterior surface of the articular eminence. Lack of harmony of centric occlusion and centric relation status is particularly important in diagnosis of TMJ problems.
cephalic  index:The ratio of the maximum width of the head to its maximum length (i.e., in horizontal plane), sometimes multiplied by 100 for convenience. The head shape can be characterized as either dolichocephalic (long headed), mesocephalic (moderate headed), or brachycephalic (broad headed).

Treatment may utilize fixed and/or removable orthodontic appliances and may also include functional and/or orthopedic appliances in growing and non-growing patients.   Adjunctive procedures to facilitate care may be required.  Comprehensive orthodontics may incorporate treatment phases focusing on specific objectives at various stages of dentofacial development.
compressive  deformation:The shortening of a dimension of a “body” due to a pushing force.

computerized  cephalometrics:The process of entering cephalometric data in digital format for analysis by any one or more of a variety of analyses available in software format.
computerized  digital  imaging:Substitution of a radiation detector plate for radiographic film in the film cassette. The detectors store the radiation energy at each pixel as a latent image for release into the computer in digital format. Advantages include a radiograph with a much wider dynamic range for improved edge enhancement, and the ability to change contrast in specific regions.
condyle:The rounded cartilage and bone articulating element of the mandible. The superior portion of the ramus that articulates with the temporal eminence in the glenoid fossa.

condylion:The highest point on the superior outline of the mandibular condyle.
continuous  orthodontic  force:Action of an appliance against the dentition that decreases little in magnitude during the between-appointments period.
corticotomy:In bone surgery, a corticotomy is a cutting of the bone that splits it in two but involves cortex only, leaving intact the medullary vessels and periosteum.. Corticotomy is particularly important in distraction osteogenesis and also where RAP (regional acceleratory phenomenon) is used to accelerate tooth movement.
cosmetic  orthodontics:Orthodontic therapy, the purpose of which is limited to improving the appearance of the teeth or face.
couple:A pair of equal and opposite non-collinear forces applied to a body. A couple always results in the creation of a pure moment with a tendency to rotate around the center of resistance.
couple -force  ratio:The ratio of magnitudes of the crown couple to the crown force, having net units of length (e.g., mm), in the two-dimensional analysis of tooth movement.
coupling:Designates the stereotyped sequence of bone resorption- formation within the evolving secondary harvesian systems. It involves the concerted action of the osteoclasts and osteoblasts.
cranial  base:The inferior part of the skull or the brain case that forms predominantly by endochondral ossification. Because the bones of the cranial base stop growing relatively early, they are often used as a reference in the superimposition of serial cephalograms or tracings to measure changes due to growth, time and treatment.
craniometry:The direct measurement of dry skulls; an anthropometric technique that forms the basis of cephalometric radiography.
crepitus:A grating or grinding sound in a moving joint or fracture.

twin  block  appliance:A functional appliance developed by William Clark, with inclined planes on maxillary and mandibular components, to guide the mandible forward.
twin  bracket:An edgewise bracket formed by two single brackets side by side on one base. (B. Swain)
- U  -
ugly  duckling  stage:A stage of dental development during the incisor transition, characterized generally by linguoversion of mandibular lateral incisors, malalignment and flaring of maxillary lateral incisors, and a median diastema between the maxillary central incisors. These aberrations may be self-corrective, but could persist and require treatment. B.H. Broadbent “coined” the term.
underbite:An ambiguous non-technical term for negative overjet. (archaic)
undermining  resorption:A microscopic local condition in which resorption may occur beyond the active area, undermining bone spicules and so leading to their more rapid removal.
unilateral:Relating to one side.
universal  appliance:An orthodontic appliance developed by S.R. Atkinson which combined some of the principles of edgewise and ribbon arch appliances with very light archwires.
uprighting:Tipping inclined teeth to a more normal vertical axial inclination.
utility  arch:Used in the edgewise technique to upright molars and depress anterior teeth similar to a step-down or by-pass arch, developed by R. Ricketts.
- V  -
velopharyngeal  insufficiency  (VPI ) Anatomic or functional deficiency in the soft palate or superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle which affects closure of the opening between the mouth and the nose in speech. The result is in a 'nasal' speech quality.
veneer:A protective or ornamental facing. Often used as a restoration to alter the shade and shape of the teeth for esthetics.  
vertex  (anatomy ) The most superior point on the top of the skull.
vertical  dimension:The vertical distance between two selected anatomic or marked points; specifically relates to the vertical relationship of the mandible to the maxilla.
vertical  elastic  traction:Pertaining to forces occlusally directed and delivered through orthodontic attachments to tooth crowns as the result of the (stretching) activation of an 'up-and-down' elastic band.
vestibular  screen:(oral screen) A removable appliance, used to deflect or eliminate muscle forces on certain teeth.  Commonly placed in the vestibule between the lips, cheeks and the teeth.
vestibule:The portion of the oral cavity that is bounded on the medial side by the gingiva, alveolar process, teeth and on the lateral side by the lips or cheek.
visceral  swallowing:The term used to describe the swallowing pattern in which the tongue is thrust between the teeth (i.e., infantile swallowing pattern).
Visual  Treatment  Objective  (VTO ) A diagnostic and communication aid that consists of a cephalometric tracing or computerized projection which is modified to show anticipated changes in the course of treatment.
voxel:A three-dimensional version of a pixel. Voxels are generated by computer-based imaging systems, such as CT and MRI. Using voxels, three-dimensional simulations of objects can be reconstructed by imaging systems.
vulcanite:An obsolete material that was used to fabricate removable appliances. It is a combination of caoutchouc and sulfur. It hardens in the presence of certain heat and pressure.

- W  -
w  arch:W-shaped maxillary expansion arch, usually soldered to the lingual of the maxillary molars. (Also known as Porter arch.)
Waldeyer’s  ring  (Waldeyer's  tonsillar  ring ) Anatomical term that describes the lymphoid tissue ring located in the pharynx.The ring consists of (from superior to inferior) the adenoids, tubal tonsils, palatine tonsils and the lingual tonsils.

working  side:The lateral segment of the dentition toward which the mandible is moved during masticatory function.
World  Federation  of  Orthodontists  (WFO ) An organization of orthodontic specialists formed initially by 69 orthodontic organizations from 62 countries at the 4th International Congress in San Francisco, CA, USA on May 15, 1995. The purpose of the WFO is to advance the art and science of orthodontics throughout the world.
- X  -
x -bite:Abbreviation for crossbite.
x -ray:Electromagnetic radiation produced when electrons strike a target under high voltage in a vacuum. The term is sometimes used incorrectly as a synonym for radiograph.
xerostomia:A symptom in which too little saliva is produced in the mouth. Also called ‘dry mouth’.
